# Simple web app

Implements a simple web app for signups to UCAS open day small group discussions. Built on Python2.7 using bottle.py, and connected to the School of Computer Science webserver using AJP via flup.

## Dependencies

Python 2.7 and associated libraries:

    $ pip install flup mysql-python bottle bottle-mysql
    
Of course, bottle.py is a single-file web framework so could simply be copied directly into the relevant directory.
